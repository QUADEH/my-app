      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>My name is Quade Hudson and I am a Software Engineer. 
        I currently live in Greenfield, Wisconsin with my boyfriend, Godfrey, of almost three years and
        dog of thirteen years, Wagz.</p>

      <p> I was born and raised in North Carolina-the Raliegh-Durham area-
        and I've been exploring the world ever since I ventured beyond the small town I grew up in. There wasn't- and still isn't-
        much out there in the way of sightseeing. But if it weren't for Benson, NC, I wouldn't be the person I am, today.</p>

        I grew up poor with young mother who was still going to high school, at the time. She eventually met my step-father
        and started a family; giving me a half-brother, a half-sister, and a step-brother. We didn't have much but my parents
        tried their to give us the best childhoods they could.

      <p> My grandparents and great grandparents were very formative in my life, having been the reason I could go on vacations
          or participate in things I typically couldn't afford. If it weren't for them, I wouldn't have made some friends that
          I still have to this day. My grandparents still support me to this day and I'm sure if my great grandparents were still
          alive, today, they would still be.

      <p>I figuratively struck out on my own, during College, and made a life for myself with friends irreplaceable, to this day.
          During my last year of schooling, I decided to move out to the MidWest and I chose to live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
          for the time being.
